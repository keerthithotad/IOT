# IOT
Soil moisture detection
In this project, I will talk about Soil Moisture Sensor and how can we save water in our home gardens by Interfacing Soil Moisture Sensor with Arduino and controlling the water supply to plants.

	In the current phase, one of the world's major problems is lack of water and water is consumed abundantly in agriculture. Therefore an appropriate water consumption system is required. 

	Currently, almost all irrigation systems are physically regulated. The transformation in the information technology has removed lots of impossibilities. 

	In these years, the rise of our cell phones, tablets, automobiles, "smart" technology has expand the market and has transformed into another standard in the business. 

	Internet of things empower the specific inter relationship among several appliances, equipment, and services based on Internet and this technology also helps further to provide comfort to people to do work easily.

	Smart irrigation is an innovative scenario where many researchers are taking interest and for decades it is developing and emerging.
# steps to follow
install Arduino IDE .

Arduino IDE we must install the libraries and the drivers to work with the ESP8266 based Models.

So after starting the arduino IDE we must install these board libraries. To do so, do the following:
Go to File -> Preferences;
On the Additional Boards Manager URLs field enter: 
		
		"http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json" (without commas).
USED LIBRARIES: 
 	
		Adafruit ESP8266, Adafruit MQTT Library, DHT Sensor library
Press OK and restart the Arduino IDE.
Now if we start a new project,
go to tools,
we can select the ESP8266 Boards!

Copy and paste the code from the CODE file, or open it using the Arduino IDE.
# NOTE
use all the required hardwares.
1.	NodeMCU (ESP8266): NodeMCU is a low cost IOT platform. It initially included firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which was based on the ESP-12 module.

2.	Moisture sensor: This moisture sensor can be used for detecting the moisture of soil or judge if there is water around the sensor.

3.	Breadboard.

4.	Jumper wires.

5.	Micro USB Cable.
