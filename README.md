Soil moisture detection
In this project, I will talk about Soil Moisture Sensor and how can we save water in our home gardens by Interfacing Soil Moisture Sensor with Arduino and controlling the water supply to plants.

	In the current phase, one of the world's major problems is lack of water and water is consumed abundantly in agriculture. Therefore an appropriate water consumption system is required. 

	Currently, almost all irrigation systems are physically regulated. The transformation in the information technology has removed lots of impossibilities. 

	In these years, the rise of our cell phones, tablets, automobiles, "smart" technology has expand the market and has transformed into another standard in the business. 

	Internet of things empower the specific inter relationship among several appliances, equipment, and services based on Internet and this technology also helps further to provide comfort to people to do work easily.

	Smart irrigation is an innovative scenario where many researchers are taking interest and for decades it is developing and emerging.
